## Description
In this Node.js project, I utilized Express and Prisma to create a RESTful API that implements CRUD operations. The focus of this assignment was to enhance my comprehension of APIs and gain practical experience with these technologies, specifically JWT authentication. Express was used to manage the API's routing and HTTP request/response handling, while Prisma was integrated to connect to and manage the database. Developing this API enabled me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various components required to create and consume an API, as well as the crucial role that each technology, including JWT, plays in this process.
